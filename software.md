# Software

## OS - Host

1. CentOS 7 as host OS for the system

Important: 
Change in `/etc/default/grub` to blacklist nouveau and enable IOMMU (in my case for Intel-CPU; a different option for AMD required)
> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="vconsole.keymap=jp106 crashkernel=auto  vconsole.font=latarcyrheb-sun16 rhgb rd.driver.pre=vfio-pci rdblacklist=nouveau text intel_iommu=on"

Make sure to blacklist (e.g. via file `/etc/blacklist.conf`) some driver conflicting with nVidia
> # generated by nvidia-installer
> blacklist nouveau
> options nouveau modeset=0
 
Add a file like this (e.g. `local.conf`) in in folder `/etc/modprobe.d`
> options vfio-pci ids=10de:13c2,10de:0fbb


2. Linux Kernel vanilla 4.5.2, self-compiled to make 

3. nV driver 361.28


4. QEMU 2.5.1 

5. a number of dependencies solved via yum




## OS - Guest

1. Windows 8.1 Pro 64 Bit as OS for the guest

Standard installation of Windows basically; you need your own product key for activation.

Tricky part was was the basic installation to turn off the standard VGA emulation and force Windows to use the GPU card for output. This eventually avoided trouble during startup


2. nV-CUDA driver 7.5
